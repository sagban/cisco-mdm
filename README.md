### Expected Problem Statement

As the Mid-Day Meal program runs in schools across the country, continuous auditing & monitoring of the program
might be challenging. Typical Auditing & Monitoring could involve:
- Ensuring number of students that took meal is same number reported.
- Lunch served is same as published/reported menu.
- Alerting in case of discrepancy and capability to centrally see past records / proof (numbers & visual) for any
school.
Student teams are expected to to explore the capabilities of Meraki cameraâ€™s inbuilt Machine learning (ML) modules
and develop solutions to monitor the activities under the Mid-day Meal Scheme.
